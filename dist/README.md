# Distribution Build

This directory contains the single-file build of the AI Engineering Roadmap, ready for deployment to GitHub Pages.

## What's Inside

**`index.html`** - A self-contained HTML file (~100 KB) with all assets inlined:
- Complete HTML structure
- All CSS styles (inlined `<style>` tag)
- All JavaScript code (validator.js + app.js inlined)
- Complete roadmap data (30 topics + 9 capstones as inline JSON)

## How It Works

The build process (via `build-single-file.js`) combines:

```
site/index.html       (7.2 KB)
+ site/style.css      (28.6 KB)  → Inlined as <style>
+ validator.js        (15.7 KB)  → Inlined as <script>
+ site/app.js         (12.4 KB)  → Inlined as <script>
+ site/roadmap.json   (35.9 KB)  → Inlined as JavaScript constant
─────────────────────────────────
= dist/index.html     (100 KB)   ✅ Well under 500 KB target
```

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

1. Copy `dist/index.html` to the root of your `gh-pages` branch:
   ```bash
   cp dist/index.html ./index.html
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Deploy v2.0"
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```

2. Or use GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` when available)

### Static Hosting (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

Simply upload `dist/index.html` as your site's entry point.

## Features

✅ **Zero external dependencies** - Works completely offline  
✅ **localStorage progress** - Saves user progress automatically  
✅ **SEO-friendly** - Structured data and noscript fallback included  
✅ **Fully functional** - Import/export, filters, all features work  
✅ **Fast loading** - Single 100 KB file loads quickly  

## Testing Locally

```bash
cd dist
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Visit http://localhost:8080
```

Or just open `index.html` directly in a browser (file:// protocol).

## Rebuilding

To rebuild from source after changes:

```bash
cd /path/to/repo
node build-single-file.js
```

This regenerates `dist/index.html` from the latest `site/` files.

## Size Optimization

Current: **100 KB** (Target: <500 KB ✅)

If size ever becomes an issue:
- Minify CSS (could save ~10 KB)
- Minify JavaScript (could save ~5 KB)
- Remove CSS comments (could save ~3 KB)
- Compress images if any are added

## Comparison

| Version | Size | Structure | Best For |
|---------|------|-----------|----------|
| **site/** | ~104 KB total | Modular (4 files) | Development, maintenance |
| **dist/index.html** | 100 KB | Single file | Deployment, sharing |
