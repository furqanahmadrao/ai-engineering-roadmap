# AI Engineering Roadmap - Capstone Projects

This directory contains detailed specifications for capstone projects organized by role.

## Overview

Capstone projects are comprehensive, portfolio-worthy projects that demonstrate mastery of multiple topics. Each capstone integrates skills from 5-10 topics and results in a deployed, production-ready system.

## Detailed Specifications

Currently, we have **3 fully detailed capstone specifications**:

1. **Production RAG Q&A System** (NLP) - Complete guide with rubric, starter template, resources
2. **End-to-End ML Deployment Pipeline** (MLOps) - Complete MLOps workflow specification
3. **Multi-Modal Recommendation System** (ML) - Advanced ML system with multi-modal data

The remaining 6 capstones have basic outlines in the roadmap.json and will be expanded in future updates.

## Grading

All capstones follow a similar rubric structure:

- **Functionality** (30-35%): Does it work as specified?
- **Reproducibility** (15-20%): Can others run it?
- **Tests** (10-15%): Adequate test coverage?
- **Evaluation** (10-15%): Proper metrics and analysis?
- **Writeup** (10-15%): Clear documentation?
- **Deployment** (10%): Successfully deployed?

Total: 100 points + optional bonus points
